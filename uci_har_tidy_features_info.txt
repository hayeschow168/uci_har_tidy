Feature Selection 
=================

The features selected for this database come from the accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals tAcc xyz and tGyro xyz. These time domain signals (prefix 't' to denote time) were captured at a constant rate of 50 Hz. Then they were filtered using a median filter and a 3rd order low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 20 Hz to remove noise. Similarly, the acceleration signal was then separated into body and gravity acceleration signals (tBodyAcc xyz and tGravityAcc xyz) using another low pass Butterworth filter with a corner frequency of 0.3 Hz. 

Subsequently, the body linear acceleration and angular velocity were derived in time to obtain Jerk signals (tBodyAccJerk xyz and tBodyGyroJerk xyz). Also the magnitude of these three-dimensional signals were calculated using the Euclidean norm (tBodyAccMag, tGravityAccMag, tBodyAccJerkMag, tBodyGyroMag, tBodyGyroJerkMag). 

Finally a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) was applied to some of these signals producing fBodyAcc xyz, fBodyAccJerk xyz, fBodyGyro xyz, fBodyAccJerkMag, fBodyGyroMag, fBodyGyroJerkMag. (Note the 'f' to indicate frequency domain signals). 

These signals were used to estimate variables of the feature vector for each pattern:  
' xyz' is used to denote 3-axial signals in the X, Y and Z directions.

t body acc xyz
t gravity acc xyz
t body acc jerk xyz
t body gyro xyz
t body gyro jerk xyz
t body acc mag
t gravity acc mag
t body acc jerk mag
t body gyro mag
t body gyro jerk mag
f body acc xyz
f body acc jerk xyz
f body acc jerk xyz
f body gyro xyz
f body acc mag
f body acc jerk mag
f body gyro mag
f body gyro jerk mag


The set of variables that were estimated from these signals are: 

mean: Mean value
std: Standard deviation
mean freq: Weighted average of the frequency components to obtain a mean frequency
angle: Angle between to vectors.

Additional vectors obtained by averaging the signals in a signal window sample. These are used on the angle variable:

gravity mean
t body acc mean
t body acc jerk mean
t body acc jerk mean
t body gyro mean
t body gyro jerk mean
